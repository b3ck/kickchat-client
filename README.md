# ðŸŸ¢ KickChat Client

## **What is Kick Chat Client ?**

The KickChat Client is a small, TypeScript-based wrapper for [kick.com](https://kick.com)'s chat system. It uses WebSocket connections to communicate with the chat servers and can automatically create new connections when the current ones reach their maximum capacity.

This wrapper is designed to simplify the process of building chat bots and other chat-related applications for the Kick platform. With its WebSocket-based architecture, it provides a fast and efficient way to communicate with the chat servers and handle incoming messages.

If you're looking to build a chat bot or other chat-based applications, the Kick Chat Wrapper is a great place to start. Its lightweight design and basic handler make it a good choice for for starting developers trying to build chat bots.

# R&D Notes

- Querying chatroom IDs from the current unofficial public API endpoint requires bypassing cloudflare.
- Sending messages, replies, and reactions also require IP whitelisting.
- There is currently no official API from the Kick team, and attempting to access the public endpoint will mostly result in receiving 403 errors or cloudflare.
